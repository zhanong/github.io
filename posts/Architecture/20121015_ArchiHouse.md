This second-year studio project proposed a 1,500-square-meter dormitory for 80 architecture students. Acknowledging that these students frequently work in their dorms, the design prioritizes a large, shared common area to foster collaboration by making personal spaces more efficient.

The solution features semi-private rooms arranged in four-person suites. Folding doors between rooms allow students to create either private zones or larger, connected spaces for group work. This layered design offers maximum spatial flexibility, balancing the need for individual focus with the benefits of a strong studio community.
