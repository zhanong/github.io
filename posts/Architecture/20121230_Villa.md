Designed in a second-year studio, this house for a social family is set in a tranquil, forested site next to a bamboo grove. The concept is a protective "box" with an unconventional roof composed of six staggered slabs. This creates clerestory windows that fill the home with light and views.

Life is organized around a central courtyard, which acts as a light well and a visual hub connecting the interior spaces to each other and to the bamboo grove outside. Spatial continuity is enhanced by interior windows and walls that are detached from the ceiling, resulting in an open, flowing layout.
