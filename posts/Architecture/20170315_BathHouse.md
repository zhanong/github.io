For a Tokyo Institute of Technology project, we designed a low-cost vacation home on Ogishima island, where a unique bathing culture promotes community sharing. The challenge was to renovate an old barn on a tight budget without heavy machinery, creating a space that balanced the owners' privacy with the island's communal customs.

Our solution is a versatile corridor built with salvaged materials. Using adjustable sliding doors, this structure can be configured as a private bathing area for visiting neighbors or be opened up to serve as a guest room with an ocean view. This design was inexpensive, required minimal construction skills, and respected local traditions.
