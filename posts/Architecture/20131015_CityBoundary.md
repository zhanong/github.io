For a third-year studio project, I designed a bus terminal for suburban Guangzhou, focusing on the concept of the terminal as a symbolic "boundary" to the city. My goal was to create a tangible feeling of arrival or departure.

The design organizes programmatic functions into distinct "layers," which are then stacked. To make the experience of moving through these layers more memorable, each is given a unique spatial quality (e.g., high and bright vs. dark and narrow). This strategy of creating a sequence of contrasting spaces reinforces the feeling of crossing a threshold.
