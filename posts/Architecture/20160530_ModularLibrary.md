This diploma project originated from a workshop inspired by a client's ambition to develop a desert island into a tourist attraction. Our academic advisor initiated the workshop to explore modular construction as the primary development approach. However, our focus shifted from tourism to the practicalities of construction, specifically how different building systems could be coordinated within a modular framework. Consequently, each student was tasked with designing a modular building, giving general consideration to the island's overall plan.

During the first half of the workshop, we collaborated on a detailed investigation of modular construction. This research covered a range of topics, including construction details, transportation limitations, material modularity, and standard dimensions for furniture and rooms. This foundational research provided solid support for our subsequent design work.

My proposal is a library located on the island's northeastern shore. The concept of placing a structure on a desert island using modular methods reminded me of a spaceship landing in an unfamiliar place. This inspired the use of a triangle as a recurring motif, chosen for its distinct geometric identity and its potential to create unique spatial experiences.

The main challenges were twofold. The first was designing specifically for modularity, where the construction process itself is a primary consideration. The second was addressing the island's lack of infrastructure, making the acquisition and conservation of water and power a top priority for the proposal.
