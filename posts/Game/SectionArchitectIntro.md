As a former architect, I created a game to bring **architectural analysis drawings** to life. It's a side-scrolling construction and management simulation where you build a project, rent out rooms, and earn money to expand.

The game features four types of rooms: **office**, **commercial**, **residential**, and **public facilities**. Each has a unique way of generating income; for instance, **office** rent depends on the number of employees present, while **commercial** rent is based on foot traffic. A key mechanic is managing **tenant satisfaction** through factors like good views, gardens, and amenities to maximize rent from residences and keep all tenants from leaving. You also face challenges like running out of funds and surviving sudden economic crises that can bankrupt your tenants.
