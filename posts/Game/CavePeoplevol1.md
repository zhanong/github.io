I'm taking the spirit of Section Architect and launching it into a new, non-realistic world.

Deep underground, a civilization of cave dwellers dreams of the world above. Their only way out is an opening at the top of their vast cavern, and they plan to reach it by building a colossal towerâ€”their own Tower of Babel. Your job is to help them build it as high as it can possibly go.

Getting resources from the ground to the construction site is your central puzzle. To succeed, you must create a thriving society with robust production lines, vital services, and comfortable homes for your builders.

Beware! The darkness is full of dangers. You'll also need to construct a formidable defense against invasions from rival civilizations and the monstrous beasts that lurk in the shadows.
