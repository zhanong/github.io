In my first indie game, you are a gardener invited to bring life back to forgotten spaces. You will transform a variety of unique locationsâ€”from a small community plot and a tourist's sculpture garden to a solemn cemetery park. Your tools are not just shovels and seeds, but the elements of landscape design itself. By skillfully placing plants, paths, and structures, your goal is to evoke emotion and inspire new activities, creating gardens that can foster community, spark wonder, or offer a place for quiet reflection.
